📌 Project: Binary Classification on Ionosphere Dataset using Keras
This project implements a simple deep learning model to classify radar signals using the Ionosphere dataset. The model is built using Keras and trained to distinguish between "good" and "bad" signals based on 34 features.

🔍 Key Features:
  Cleaned and preprocessed real-world dataset
  Feedforward neural network with 2 hidden layers
  Trained using binary crossentropy loss and SGD optimizer
  Model achieves decent accuracy and is saved for reuse (weights.keras)

🧪 Model Architecture
- Input Layer: 34 features  
- Hidden Layer 1: 10 neurons, ReLU activation  
- Hidden Layer 2: 5 neurons, ReLU activation  
- Output Layer: 1 neuron, Sigmoid activation (binary output)
